[[retail.sect.components]]
== Components


{smr} uses a layered architecture:

* The first layer contains the central server and one or more build hosts.
* The second layer contains one or more branch servers to provide local network and boot services.
* The final layer contains any number of deployed point-of-sale terminals.

[[retail.sect.components.central-server]]
=== Central Server

The central server is a {susemgr} server.
It contains information about infrastructure, network topology, and everything required to automate image deployment and perform day-to-day operations of branches and terminals.
This can include database entries of registered systems, salt pillar data for build images, image assignments, partitioning, network setup, network services, and more.

[[retail.sect.components.build-hosts]]
=== Build Hosts

Build hosts can be arbitrary servers or virtual machines.
They are used to securely build operating system images.
Build hosts should be based on {sls}{nbsp}12 SP{nbsp}3.

[[retail.sect.components.branch-server]]
=== Branch Server

Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-sale terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office.
Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, salt broker, and RPM proxy.
Depending on how you configure your branch server, it can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services.

The branch server layer can operate in several different network configurations:

* The branch server has a dedicated network interface card and terminals use an isolated internal branch network.
* The branch server manages the internal network and provides DHCP, DNS, PXE, FTP, and TFTP services.
* The branch server shares a network with the terminals, and provides a connection to the central server.
* The branch server does not manage a network, but acts as a PXE boot server and provides FTP and TFTP services.
In this configuration, it may or may not provide DHCP and DNS services.

[[retail.sect.components.pos-terminals]]
=== Point-of-Sale Terminals

Point-of-sale (PoS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as cashier terminals, digital scales, or cash drawers.
Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set some basic information about the device in the firmware.
{smr} accesses this vendor information in order to determine how best to work with the terminal in use.
In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly.
For example, a cashier terminal has a full graphical display, where a digital scale might only have a very basic text display.
While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images to ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly.



[[retail.sect.components.fitting]]
== Fitting it all together


{smr} uses the same underlying technology as {susemgr}, but specifically addresses the needs of retail organizations.



[[retail.sect.components.fitting.hardware-types]]
=== Hardware Types
Because every environment is different, and can contain many different configurations of many different terminals, {smr} uses hardware types to simplify device management.

Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name, so that all devices of a particular type can be managed as one.



[[retail.sect.components.fitting.formulas]]
=== Formulas

{smr} uses formulas to help simplify configuration.
Formulas are pre-written scripts, that are used to configure your installation.

You can use formulas to apply configuration patterns to your hardware groups.
{smr} uses the Saltboot formula, which defines partitioning and OS images for terminals.

You can use default settings for formulas, or edit them to make them more specific to your environment.



[[retail.sect.components.fitting.system-groups]]
=== System Groups

{smr} uses system groups to organize the various devices in your environment.

You can create your own system groups using the {susemgr} {webui}.
Navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups] and click on [btn]``+ Create System Group``.

We suggest you create a system group for each branch, containing a single branch server, and the PoS terminals associated with that server.
