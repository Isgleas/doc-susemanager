Sometimes when attempting to reboot a Salt minion after applying a formula, the terminal will hang at the boot screen.
This can be caused by a presence ping timeout value being set at a value that is too low.
You can adjust the presence ping timeout value to fix this problem
For more information about ping timeouts on Salt minions, see xref:salt:salt-rate-limiting.adoc[].
