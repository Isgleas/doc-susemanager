= Troubleshooting Disk Space


If you need to reclaim more disk space, try these suggestions:

* Remove custom channels (you cannot remove official SUSE channels)
* Use the [command]``spacewalk-data-fsck --help`` command to compare the spacewalk database to the filesystem and remove entries if either is missing.
