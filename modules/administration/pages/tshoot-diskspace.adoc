= Troubleshooting Disk Space

When you prepare to install {productname}, you need to be careful that you allow  enough disk space.
Running out of disk space can have a severe impact on the {productname} database and file structure which, in most cases, is not recoverable.
You will need to carefully monitor the  amount of disk space you have  available on your systems to prevent this from happening.

If you notice disk space is running low, reclaim space before it runs too low with these suggestions.



== Unused Custom Channels

You cannot remove official SUSE channels, but if you have set up custom channels that you are no longer using, you can delete them to reclaim disk space.



== Redundant Database Entries

Use the [command]``spacewalk-data-fsck --help`` command to list the options for working with the database, and deleting any  orphaned database entries.
