= Virtualization

{productname} supports virtualized client machines, but they are handled differently depending on which third-party virtualization provider you use.

Xen and KVM virtualized clients can be managed directly in {productname}.
This enables you to autoinstall virtual hosts and guests using {ay} or {kickstart}, and manage guests in the same way as you manage other clients.

For VMWare virtualized clients, including vCenter/vSphere and ESXi, {productname} requires you to set up a virtual host manager, or VHM, to control the VMs.

Other third-party virtualization providers are not directly supported by {productname}.
However, if your provider allows you to export a JSON configuration file for the VM, you can upload that configuration file to {productname} and manage it with a VHM.
