{productname} allows you to autoinstall and manage {xen} and {kvm} {vmguest}s on a registered {vmhost}.
To autoinstall a {vmguest}, an autoinstallable distribution and an autoinstallation profile ({ay} or {kickstart}) need to exist on {productname}.
{vmguest}s registered with {productname} can be managed like "`regular`" machines.
In addition, basic {vmguest} management tasks such as (re)starting and stopping or changing processor and memory allocation can be carried out using {productname}.
