= Client Registration Overview

There are two ways to register clients to your {productname} Server.
Both methods work for either traditional or salt clients.

The simplest method is to register your clients using the {productname} {webui}.

If you need to have more control over the process, or want to register many clients, we  recommend using a bootstrap script.

Both methods are described in this manual.
