= Configuration Channels

As mentioned above, {productname} manages both central and local configuration channels and files.
Central configuration management allows you to deploy configuration files to multiple systems (both traditional clients ([Management]) and Salt minions ([Salt])).
Local configuration management is available for traditional clients ([Management]) only and allows you to specify overrides or configuration files that are not changed by subscribing the system to a central channel.

A "`state channel`" is a type of a configuration channel but for Salt minion only.
For a state channel, the [path]``init.sls`` file is not auto-generated, the user creates and edits it.
Additionally, state channels can contain arbitrary configuration files that could be referenced from within the [path]``init.sls`` file.
Therefore, state channels effectively replace custom states.

.Referencing Configuration Files with Organization ID
[NOTE]
====
You must reference configuration files with the `salt://` prefix, the organization ID, and the channel name.
For example, to reference [path]``/etc/motd`` use:

----
file.managed:  - source: salt://manager_org_1/`channel_name`/etc/motd
----
====


Central configuration or state channels must be created via the links on this page.

Click the name of the configuration channel to see the details page for that channel.
If you click the number of files in the channel, you are taken to the [guimenu]``List/Remove Files`` page of that channel.
If you click the number of systems subscribed to the configuration channel, you are taken to the menu:Configuration Channel Details[Systems > Subscribed   Systems] page for that channel.

To create a new central configuration channel:

[[proc.config.channels.create.cfgch]]
.Procedure: Creating Central Configuration Channel
. Click the [guimenu]``Create Config Channel`` link in the upper right corner of this screen.
. Enter a name for the channel.
. Enter a label for the channel. This field must contain only letters, numbers, hyphens (``-``) and underscores (``_``).
. Enter a mandatory description for the channel that allows you to distinguish it from other channels. No character restrictions apply.
. Click the btn:[Create Config Channel] button to create the new channel.
. The following page is a subset of the [guimenu]``Channel Details`` page and has three tabs: [guimenu]``Overview`` , [guimenu]``Add Files`` , and [guimenu]``Systems`` . The [guimenu]``Channel Details`` page is discussed in <<config-config-channels-channel-details>>.


To create a new state channel with an [path]``init.sls`` file:

[[proc.config.channels.create.statech]]
.Procedure: Creating State Channel [Salt]
. Click the [guimenu]``Create State Channel`` link in the upper right corner of this screen.
. Enter a name for the channel.
. Enter a label for the channel. This field must contain only letters, numbers, hyphens (``-``) and underscores (``_``).
. Enter a mandatory description for the channel that allows you to distinguish it from other channels. No character restrictions apply.
. Enter the [guimenu]``SLS Contents`` for the [path]``init.sls`` file.
. Click the btn:[Create Config Channel] button to create the new channel.
. The following page is a subset of the [guimenu]``Channel Details`` page and has four tabs: [guimenu]``Overview``, [guimenu]``List/Remove Files``, [guimenu]``Add Files``, and [guimenu]``Systems``. The [guimenu]``Channel Details`` page is discussed in <<config-config-channels-channel-details>>.


[[config-config-channels-channel-details]]
== menu:Main Menu[Configuration > Configuration Channels > Configuration Channel Details]

Overview::
The [guimenu]``Overview`` page of the [guimenu]``Configuration Channel Details``
page is divided into several panels.

Channel Information:::
The panel provides status information for the contents of the channel.

Configuration Actions:::
The panel provides access to the most common configuration tasks.
For Salt minions, there is a link to edit the [path]``init.sls`` file.

Channel Properties [Management]:::
By clicking the [guimenu]``Edit Properties`` link, you can edit the name, label, and description of the channel.

List/Remove Files::
This page only appears if there are files in the configuration channel.
You can remove files or copy the latest versions into a set of local overrides or into other central configuration channels.
Check the box next to files you want to manipulate and click the respective action button.

Add Files::
The [guimenu]``Add Files`` page has three subtabs of its own, which allow you to [guimenu]``Upload``, [guimenu]``Import``, or [guimenu]``Create`` configuration files to be included in the channel.

Upload File:::
To upload a file into the configuration channel, browse for the file on your local system, populate all fields, and click the btn:[Upload Configuration File] button.
The [guimenu]``Filename/Path`` field is the absolute path where the file will be deployed.
+
You can set the [guimenu]``Ownership`` via the [guimenu]``user name`` and [guimenu]``group name`` and the [guimenu]``Permissions`` of the file when it is deployed.
+
If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure [guimenu]``SELinux contexts`` to enable the required file attributes (such as user, role, and file type).
+
If the configuration file includes a macro (a variable in a configuration file), enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro.
For more information on using macros, see <<s3-sm-file-macros>>.
+
Import Files:::
To import files from other configuration channels, including any locally-managed channels, check the box to the left of any file you want to import.
Then click the btn:[Import Configuration File(s)] button.
+

NOTE: A sandbox icon (image:spacewalk-icon-sandbox.svg[Spacewalk Icon Sandbox,scaledwidth=0.9em]) indicates that the listed file is currently located in a local sandbox.
Files in a system's sandbox are considered experimental and could be unstable.
Use caution when selecting them for a central configuration channel.
+


Create File:::
Create a configuration file, directory, or symbolic link from scratch to be included in the configuration channel.

.Procedure: Creating a Configuration File, Directory, or Symbolic Link From Scratch
... Choose whether you want to create a text file, directory, or symbolic link in the [guimenu]``File Type`` section.
... In the [path]``Filename/Path`` text box, set the absolute path to where the file should be deployed.
... If you are creating a symbolic link, indicate the target file and path in the [guimenu]``Symbolic Link Target Filename/Path`` text box.
... Enter the [guimenu]``User name`` and [guimenu]``Group name`` for the file in the [guimenu]``Ownership`` section, and the [guimenu]``File Permissions Mode``.
... If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure [guimenu]``SELinux contexts`` to enable the required file attributes (such as user, role, and file type).
... If the configuration file includes a macro, enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro.
... Then enter the configuration file content in the [guimenu]``File Contents`` field, using the script drop-down box to choose the appropriate scripting language.
... Click the btn:[Create Configuration File] button to create the new file.

Deploy Files::
This page only appears when there are files in the channel and a system is subscribed to the channel.
Deploy all files by clicking the btn:[Deploy All Files] button or check selected files and click the btn:[Deploy Selected Files] button.
Select to which systems the file(s) should be applied.
All systems subscribed to this channel are listed.
If you want to apply the file to a different system, subscribe it to the channel first.
To deploy the files, click btn:[Confirm & Deploy to Selected Systems].

Systems::
Manage systems subscribed to the configuration channel via two subtabs:

Subscribed Systems:::
All systems subscribed to the current channel are displayed.
Click the name of a system to see the [guimenu]``System Details`` page.

Target Systems:::
This subtab displays a list of systems enabled for configuration management but not yet subscribed to the channel.
To add a system to the configuration channel, check the box to the left of the system's name and click the btn:[Subscribe System] button.
