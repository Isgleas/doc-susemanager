Clicking the name of a system shows its menu:System Details[Configuration > Overview] page.

Clicking the number of local files takes you to the menu:System Details[Configuration > View/Modify Files > Locally-Managed Files] page, where you manage which local (override) files apply to the system.

Clicking the number of centrally-managed files takes you to the menu:System Details[Configuration > Manage Configuration Channels > List/Unsubscribe    from Channels] page.
Here you unsubscribe from any channels you want.
