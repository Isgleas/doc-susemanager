The menu:Main Menu[Home > Your Organization > Organization Trusts] page displays the trusts established with your organization (that is, the organization with which you, the logged-in user, are associated).
The page also lists [guimenu]``Channels Shared``, which refers to channels available to your organization via others in the established trusts.
