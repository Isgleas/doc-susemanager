This overview page displays the status of automated installations (Kickstart and {ay}) on your client systems: the types and number of profiles you have created and the progress of systems that are scheduled to be installed using Kickstart or {ay}.

In the upper right area is the menu:Autoinstallation Actions[] section, which contains a series of links to management actions for your Kickstart or {ay}  profiles.

Before reading through the various automated installation options on this page, it would be a good idea to review the following two sections for an introduction to both {ay} and Kickstart:
