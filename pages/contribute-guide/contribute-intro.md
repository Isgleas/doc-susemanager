### Contributing to SUSE Manager Documentation

If your here it means you are interested in helping us out.

## <span class="label label-success">Thank You!</span>

#### Getting Started Checklist

- Scan over our [General Markdown Rules](file-names-and-extensions.html) to help maintain a consistent style throughout your contributions.

- For any technical writing or language related questions have a look at our [SUSE Documentation Style Guide](style-guide-introduction.html).

- If you would like to contribute a little extra and help out our writers out feel free to browse our [Liquid Formatting Guide](adding-tooltips.html).

### Doc as Code

We use a `doc as code` approach, in other words we are utilizing the same techniques for reviewing our documentation as others use in reviewing their project code. This approach involves using [Github](https://github.com) to edit the documentation source files.

Our source files are written in markdown which make contribution easier. You may opt to use some of the slightly more advanced [Liquid Formatting - (E.g. Alerts)](https://suse.github.io/doc-susemanager/alerts.html#about-alerts), but this is not a requirement.

There is an `Edit me` button located on each page in our documentation. This button allows collaborators to edit the content and submit a pull request on Github.

{% include important.html content="You will need to log into your github account to edit documents and create pull requests for review. If you do not already have a github account [Sign up for Github](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) now." %}

### How to Submit a Pull Request
1. Once you have signed into Github select the `Edit me` button located at the top of any page throughout our documentation where you would like to make a change.
2. You will be directed to the Github source in our documentation repository.
3. Select the `Pencil` button (Located next to the `Trash Can`).
4. Make your changes and submit a `pull request`.
5. Your request will then be `reviewed` by a writer and if accepted will appear online within a few minutes.

{% include tip.html content="Unless there are breaking changes, most often a pull request will be accepted, edited by a writer ensuring consistent styling/formatting, and then published to our online documentation." %}
