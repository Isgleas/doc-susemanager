### Spelling and grammar

Use correct spelling and grammar.

Prefer writing in English, and in particular American English.

Rationale: American English speakers have the largest `GDP`, especially in the `computing industry`.

Use markup like URL or code on words which you do not want to add to your dictionary
so that spell checkers can ignore them automatically.

Beware of case sensitive spelling errors, in particular for project, brand names or abbreviations:

- Good: URL, LinkedIn, DoS attack
- Bad: `url`, `Linkedin`, `dos attack`

When in doubt, prefer the same abbreviation as used on Wikipedia.

Avoid informal contractions:

- Good: biography, repository, directory
- Bad: `bio`, `repo`, `dir`
