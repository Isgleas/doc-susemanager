### Audience

Before beginning to write, define the target audience of your documentation. Keep the following in mind:

- Adjust tone, style, and technicality of the text based on the intended audience. Keep in mind that not all facts that seem obvious to you will be obvious to your readers.

- If you move sections of documents into other documents, ensure to adapt the changes in to the new document.

- Document the defined target audience in the `jekyll frontmatter` of each markdown page. See the following example for using a `yaml` summary tag:

```yml
