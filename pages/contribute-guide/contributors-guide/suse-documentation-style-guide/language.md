## Language

The following rules are intentionally kept concise. When in doubt about a style rule, see:

- [The Chicago Manual of Style, 17th Edition](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).

If the use of a word is not listed in the above reference, use American English spellings as defined at:

- [Merriam Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/).


### Abbreviations

Where possible, avoid using abbreviations. Especially avoid unusual abbreviations. You may create plurals of acronyms. In all other cases, avoid creating plurals of abbreviations.

### Acronyms

Headlines or captions must not contain both an acronym and its expansion. When dealing with a term that is commonly written as an acronym, use the acronym in the title. When mentioning the term for the first time in the following text, use its expanded form. All following occurrences of the term in this chapter should then use the acronym.

Create plural forms of acronyms by adding a lowercase “s,” for example, use “CDs” and “BIOSs.” Never add an apostrophe before the “s.”

Avoid using possessive forms of acronyms (an example of `poor usage` would be `“XMLʼs specification”`).

###  Latin Abbreviations

Do not use Latin abbreviations. Use the full English form: for example, use “that is” instead of “i.e.”. As an exception to this rule, the abbreviation etc. is allowed.

### Units of Measurement

You may use abbreviations of common units of measurement. For more information on units of measurement, see:

### Capitalization and Title Style

In all running text, use sentence-style capitalization. That is, only capitalize the first word of a sentence and proper names.

Use title-style capitalization for all types of headings and titles, including figure and table titles. This style is explained in The Chicago Manual of Style 8.167. A simplified version of these rules is below:

1. Capitalize the `first` and the `last` word.

2. Write all English `articles` in lowercase. Articles are: `the, a`, and `an`.

3. Write `prepositions` in lowercase unless they are used with a verb `Logging In` or in a noun `The On Button`. Prepositions are for example: `up, in, of, through`, and `between`.

4. Write certain conjunctions in lowercase: `and, but, for, nor`, and `or`.

5. Write `as` and `to` in lowercase.

6. Capitalize everything that is not mentioned above.


### Commas

Use commas between all items in a series of three or more elements. For example, write “a, b, and c.” Use commas around phrases like for example and that is. Introductory phrases at the beginning of a sentence are normally followed by a comma. For example, “Before using YaST Online Update, configure a network connection.”

### Contractions

Do not use contractions, unless you are purposefully writing a casual document.

### Dashes

Use en dashes (–) between numbers in a range in tables and figures.

For punctuation, use em dashes (—). Do not surround em dashes with spaces. Use em dashes sparingly.

### End of Sentence Punctuation

End sentences in a period. Avoid using exclamation marks. Restrict question marks to question and answer sections.

### File and Directory Names

Under Linux, objects like directories, printers, or flash disks are all considered files. Therefore, the naming and markup conventions are the same for “drives” (for example, hard disks, CD-ROM drives, or flash disks), directories, or files.

The layout for file names and directory names is the same. See the following example:

- Use forward slashes `/` to separate nested directory or file names.

- When giving absolute paths, always start with a leading slash to indicate the root of the file system.

- Do not use a trailing slash to distinguish between a file and a directory. Where differentiation is needed, provide it textually.

- Most Linux file systems are case-sensitive. Use capitals exactly as they appear in the file system.

- When it is necessary to refer to file extensions, such as in compound words like “PDF file”, always capitalize the extension.


### Gender Bias

Avoid indicating gender in your documentation. If possible, use plural to allow use of “they” as the pronoun. Otherwise, use “he or she.”

### Headings

Keep headings short and simple. Do not use both an acronym and the written-out form in a heading. Make sure that headlines in a document follow the same pattern.

Provide at least some introductory information between a heading and its subheadings.

### Numbers and Measurements

Write the integers zero through nine as words. Use numerals for all other numbers.

When the unit of a measurement is abbreviated, always use numerals for the number. In measurements, add a non-breaking space ( &nbsp; ) between the numeral and its corresponding unit abbreviation.

For more information, refer to:

 - [The Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html)

### Possessives

Do not use possessives of acronyms and trademarked terms. Avoid possessives of inanimate objects.

### Prefixes

Add a hyphen after the prefix to prefixed words only if:

- The last letter of the prefix and the first letter of the word are the same.

- You foresee misunderstandings. For example, there is a difference in meaning between “recreate” and “re-create”.

### Semicolons

Avoid using semicolons to join sentences. You may use semicolons in place of commas in very complicated series.

### Slashes

Do not use slashes except when they are part of a standard technical term, such as TCP/IP or client/server.

### Sentence Structure

Form clear and direct sentences with 20 words or less. Avoid complicated clauses. Make sure that the relationship between subject, verb, and object are clear. Avoid joining sentences with semicolons. Avoid ending sentences with prepositions.

Avoid using parentheses. Where they are necessary, move them to the end of the sentence. Never nest parentheses.

Always let the reader know the objective of an action before describing the action itself. As an example, write: `To restore world peace, click Shake Hands.`

### Tense

Use the simple present tense. Apply the simple present tense even to sentences with `if` or `when` clauses: `If this happens, go there.`

Prerequisites of an action should be expressed in the present tense as well: `Glibc is installed.` In some cases, no verb is necessary before the prerequisite of an action: `a 1 GHz processor or better.`

### Tone and Voice

Maintain a professional tone. Do not use contractions, except in casual documents. Do not use humor. Be honest and avoid absolutes and exaggerations, but focus on positive aspects.

Use second person `you` to refer to the reader. Normally, the reader is the user or administrator that does the actions described. Do not overuse `you.` It is often understood, especially in directions.

Where possible, use active voice. In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the verb. For example, `The root user performs administrative tasks` is active voice. `Administrative tasks are performed by the root user` is passive voice.

Use passive voice if there is no emphasis on the object of the verb or if the performer of the action is unknown. `A Samba server must be configured in the network` is an example of proper use of passive voice. The emphasis is on the server, not on the person configuring it.

### Trademarks

Most products referenced in the documentation are trademarked. Follow these rules when dealing with these terms:

- Never use trademarks in headings.

- Only use the marked version on the first occurrence of the product name in a chapter.

- Only use the ®, ™, or ℠ marks for Micro Focus products.

- Use an * (asterisk) for all service marks or trademarks of third-party companies. This acknowledges the service mark or trademark of the other company. It also protects SUSE if the protection of the brand changes in any way.

### User Interface Items

When referring to labels of user interface items, do not include ending punctuation such as … or :. Whenever possible, refer to user interface items without identifying them as any special type of element. For example, use `click OK` rather than `click the OK button.` However, complex dialogs may require more specific wording.


### Quotations

Use quotations to quote from sources, such as books. In most other cases, you should not use quotation marks. For example, avoid ironic usage of words entirely. In the case of computer input and output or user interface elements, use more appropriate markup.

Punctuation directly following the quoted text should be included within the quotation marks, as illustrated in Example 4, “Quote”.
