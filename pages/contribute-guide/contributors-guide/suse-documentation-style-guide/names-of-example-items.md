###  Domains

Use `http://www.example.com` and `http://www.example.org` as example domains. Both domains were registered for use in documentation.

### Host Names

Use objects of the `solar system`: For the most important system, use `sun`. For other systems, use the names of planets such as `earth` or `mars`.

### IPv4 Addresses

Use addresses from the `class C subnet 192.168.255.0` for examples. That is, replace the final 0 by any integer between 0 and 255. To create examples using a larger setup, use addresses from the private network ranges. For more information, see:

 - [Private_network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network).

### IPv6 Addresses

Use addresses from the `subnet 2001:0db8::/32` for examples. That is, after the `2001:0db8:` prefix, add six four-digit numbers, each separated by a colon on both sides. Each of the hexadecimal digits may have a value between 0 and f. A valid example URL is `2001:0db8:0123:4567:89ab:cdef:1234:5678`. For more information, see:
