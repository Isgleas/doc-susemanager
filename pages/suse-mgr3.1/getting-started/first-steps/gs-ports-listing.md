## Firewall Rules {#firewall-rules}

In a production environment SUSE Manager server and its clients should always utilize firewall rules. The following table provides an overview of required ports for use by SUSE Manager 3.1.

Traditional client systems connect to SUSE Manager via port 443. In addition, enabling push actions from SUSE Manager to client systems, requires inbound connections on port 5222\. If SUSE Manager will also push to a SUSE Manager proxy, you must allow inbound connections on port 5269.
