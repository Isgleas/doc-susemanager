*   Just Enough Operating System (JeOS) 240 MB [https://www.suse.com/products/server/jeos/](https://www.suse.com/products/server/jeos/)

*   SLES 12 DVD image 3 GB [https://www.suse.com/products/server/download/](https://www.suse.com/products/server/download/)


{% include tip.html content="The SLES 12 JeOS image provides the quickest route for setup of a test environment. The JeOS image total size is about 240 MB. The alternative would be the 3 GB SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 DVD image. Both installation media are appropriate, but depend upon available bandwidth or your application needs. Both methods of installation will be covered in this guide." %}
