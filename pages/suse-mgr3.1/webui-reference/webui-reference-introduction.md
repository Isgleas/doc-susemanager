## About This Guide {#about-this-guide}

This manual explains the features of the Web interface and is intended for SUSE Manager administrators and administrators with restricted roles for specific tasks. On certain topics we also provide background information, while some chapters contain links to additional documentation resources. The latter include additional documentation available on the installed system as well as documentation on the Internet.

For an overview of the documentation available for your product and the latest documentation updates, refer to [http://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-manager-3/](http://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-manager-3/) or to the following section.

HTML versions of the manuals are also available from the Help tab of the SUSE Manager Web interface.
