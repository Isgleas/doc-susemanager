## Activation Keys {#activation-keys}

Users with the Activation Key Administrator role (including SUSE Manager Administrators) can generate activation keys in the SUSE Manager Web interface. With such an activation key, register a SUSE Linux Enterprise or Red Hat Enterprise Linux system, entitle the system to a SUSE Manager service level and subscribe the system to specific channels and system groups through the **rhnreg_ks** command line utility.

### Note {#note}

System-specific activation keys created through the Reactivation subtab of the System Details page are not part of this list because they are not reusable across systems.
