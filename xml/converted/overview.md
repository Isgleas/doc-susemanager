## Overview {#overview}

The System Overview page provides a summary of your systems, including their status, number of associated patches (errata) and packages, and their so-called system type. Clicking the name of a system takes you to its System Details page. Refer to [the section called “System Details”](system_details/README.md) for more information.

Clicking View System Groups at the top of the Overview page takes you to a similar summary of your system groups. It identifies group status and displays the number of systems contained. Then, clicking the number of systems takes you to the Systems tab of the System Group Details page, while clicking the group name takes you to the Details tab for that system group. Refer to [the section called “System Group Details”](system_groups/system_group_details.md) for more information.

You can also click Use in SSM in the System Groups section to go directly to the System Set Manager. Refer to [the section called “System Set Manager”](system_set_manager/README.md) for more information.
