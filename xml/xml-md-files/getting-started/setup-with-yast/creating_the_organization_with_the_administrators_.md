## Creating the Organization with the Administrator&#039;s Account {#creating-the-organization-with-the-administrator-s-account}

This section will walk you through creating the organization with the administrator&#039;s account for your SUSE Manager Server. The administrator&#039;s account is the highest authority account within SUSE Manager and therefore administrator account access information should be stored in a secure location. It is recommended that an administrator creates low level user accounts designated for administration of each organization or group under the administrator&#039;s account for security.
