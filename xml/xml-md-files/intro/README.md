## About This Guide {#about-this-guide}

SUSE® Manager enables you to efficiently manage a set of Linux systems and keep them up-to-date. It provides automated and cost-effective software management, asset management, system provisioning, and monitoring capabilities. SUSE Manager is compatible with Red Hat Satellite Server and offers seamless management of both SUSE® Linux Enterprise and Red Hat Enterprise Linux client systems.

This manual explains the features of the Web interface and is intended for SUSE Manager administrators and administrators with restricted roles for specific tasks. On certain topics we also provide background information, while some chapters contain links to additional documentation resources. The latter include additional documentation available on the installed system as well as documentation on the Internet.
