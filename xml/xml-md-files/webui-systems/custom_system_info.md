Unlike with notes, the information here is more formal and can be searched. for example, you may decide to specify an asset tag for each system. To do so, select Custom System Info from the left navigation bar and create an `asset` key.

Click Create Key in the upper-right corner of the page. Enter a suitable label and description, such as `Asset` and `Precise location of each system`, then click Create Key. The key will show up in the custom info keys list.

When the key exists, you may assign a value to it through the Custom Info tab of the System Details page. Refer to [the section called “ System Details &gt; Details &gt; Custom Info ”](system_details/system_details__details.md#system-details-details-custom-info) for instructions.
