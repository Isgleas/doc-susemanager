Active entitlements are in gray, while inactive entitlements are highlighted in yellow and their check boxes checked by default for you to delete them as needed by clicking the Delete Selected button. Entitlements are inactive if the system has not checked in with SUSE Manager in a time specified via the drop-down box A system profile is inactive if its system has not checked in for.

You can filter duplicate entitlements by IP Address, IPv6 Address, Hostname, or MAC address by clicking the respective tab. You may filter further by inactive time or typing the system&#039;s host name, IP address, IPv6 address, or MAC address in the corresponding Filter by text box.

To compare up to three duplicate entitlements at one time, click the Compare Systems link in the Last Checked In column. Inactive components of the systems are highlighted in yellow. You can then determine which systems are inactive or duplicate and delete them by clicking the Delete System Profile button. Click the Confirm Deletion button to confirm your choice.
